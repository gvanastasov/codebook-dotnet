### Dependency Injection (DI) in .NET

#### Introduction
Dependency Injection (DI) is a design pattern used to implement Inversion of Control (IoC) between classes and their dependencies. It allows for better modularity, testability, and maintainability of code by decoupling the creation of dependencies from their usage.

#### Understanding DI Basics
- **Dependency**: An object that another object depends on.
- **Injection**: The process of providing the dependency to the dependent object.
- **Inversion of Control (IoC)**: A principle where the control of object creation and lifecycle is inverted from the dependent object to an external entity.

#### Benefits of DI
- **Decoupling**: Reduces the tight coupling between classes and their dependencies.
- **Testability**: Makes it easier to unit test classes by allowing dependencies to be mocked or stubbed.
- **Maintainability**: Simplifies the management of dependencies and their lifecycles.
