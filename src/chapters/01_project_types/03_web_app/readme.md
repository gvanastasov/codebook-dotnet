### ASP.NET Core Web Applications

#### Introduction
ASP.NET Core is a cross-platform, high-performance framework for building modern, cloud-based, and internet-connected applications. ASP.NET Core Web Applications are used to create dynamic web pages, web APIs, and real-time applications.

#### Use Cases
ASP.NET Core Web Applications are commonly used for:
- **Websites and Web Applications**: Building dynamic and interactive websites.
- **Web APIs**: Creating RESTful services that can be consumed by client applications.
- **Real-Time Applications**: Developing applications that require real-time communication, such as chat applications or live updates.

#### Creating an ASP.NET Core Web Application

1. **Open the terminal in Visual Studio Code.**
2. **Navigate to the directory where you want to create the project**
3. **Create a new ASP.NET Core Web Application using the `dotnet` CLI:**

```sh
dotnet new webapp -n web_app
```

This command creates a new directory named `web_app` with the necessary files for an ASP.NET Core Web Application.

4. **Navigate to the project directory:**

```sh
cd web_app
```

5. Optional: **Open the project in Visual Studio Code:**

```sh
code .
```

6. **Run the project:**

```sh
dotnet run
```

#### Understanding the Project Structure
- `Pages`: This directory contains Razor Pages, which are used to build the UI of the application.
- `Properties`: This directory contains configuration files, such as `launchSettings.json`, which is used to configure how the application is launched.
- `wwwroot`: This directory is the web root and contains static files such as CSS, JavaScript, and images.
- `appsettings.json`: This file contains configuration settings for the application, such as connection strings and application-specific settings.
- `Program.cs`: This is the main file where the application starts executing. It contains the `Main` method and sets up the web host.
- `web_app.csproj`: This is the project file that contains information about the project and its dependencies.

#### Running the Web Application
To run the application, use the following command in the terminal:
```sh
dotnet run
