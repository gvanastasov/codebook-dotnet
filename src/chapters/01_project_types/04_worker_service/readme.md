### Worker Services

#### Introduction
Worker Services in .NET are long-running background services that are typically used for processing tasks in the background, such as message queue processing, scheduled tasks, or any other background processing needs.

#### Use Cases
Worker Services are commonly used for:
- **Background Processing**: Running tasks in the background without user interaction.
- **Message Queue Processing**: Consuming and processing messages from a message queue.
- **Scheduled Tasks**: Running tasks on a schedule, such as data cleanup or report generation.
- **Microservices**: Implementing microservices that perform specific tasks independently.

#### Creating a Worker Service

1. **Open the terminal in Visual Studio Code.**
2. **Navigate to the directory where you want to create the project**
3. **Create a new Worker Service using the `dotnet` CLI:**
```sh
dotnet new worker -n worker_service
```
This command creates a new directory named `worker_service` with the necessary files for a Worker Service.

4. **Navigate to the project directory:**
```sh
cd worker_service
```

5. Optional: **Open the project in Visual Studio Code:**
```sh
code .
```

#### Understanding the Project Structure
- `Worker.cs`: This file contains the implementation of the background service. It inherits from `BackgroundService` and overrides the `ExecuteAsync` method to define the work to be done.
- `Program.cs`: This is the main file where the application starts executing. It contains the `Main` method and sets up the host for the worker service.
- `worker_service.csproj`: This is the project file that contains information about the project and its dependencies.

#### Running the Worker Service
To run the application, use the following command in the terminal:
```sh
dotnet run
```
