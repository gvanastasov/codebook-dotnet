### Windows Applications

#### Introduction
Windows Applications in .NET can be built using WinForms or WPF (Windows Presentation Foundation). These frameworks allow you to create rich desktop applications with graphical user interfaces.

#### Use Cases
Windows Applications are commonly used for:
- **Desktop Applications**: Building applications with graphical user interfaces for Windows.
- **Data Entry Applications**: Creating forms and interfaces for data entry and management.
- **Rich Client Applications**: Developing applications with complex user interactions and visualizations.

#### Creating a WinForms Application

1. **Open the terminal in Visual Studio Code.**
2. **Navigate to the directory where you want to create the project**
3. **Create a new WinForms application using the `dotnet` CLI:**
```sh
dotnet new winforms -n 05_windows_app
```

This command creates a new directory named `05_windows_app` with the necessary files for a WinForms application.

4. **Navigate to the project directory:**
```sh
cd 05_windows_app
```

5. Optional: **Open the project in Visual Studio Code:**
```sh
code .
```

#### Understanding the Project Structure
- `Form1.cs`: This file contains the code for the main form of the application.
- `Form1.Designer.cs`: This file contains the automatically generated code that defines the layout and properties of the controls on the form. It is maintained by the Visual Studio designer.
- `Program.cs`: This is the main file where the application starts executing. It contains the `Main` method and sets up the application.
- `05_windows_app.csproj`: This is the project file that contains information about the project and its dependencies.

#### Running the WinForms Application
To run the application, use the following command in the terminal:
```sh
dotnet run
```
