### Blazor Applications

#### Introduction
Blazor is a framework for building interactive web applications using C# instead of JavaScript. Blazor can run client-side in the browser using WebAssembly or server-side in ASP.NET Core.

#### Use Cases
Blazor Applications are commonly used for:
- **Single Page Applications (SPAs)**: Building rich, interactive web applications with a single page.
- **Real-Time Applications**: Developing applications that require real-time updates and interactions.
- **Reusable Components**: Creating reusable UI components that can be shared across different parts of the application.

#### Creating a Blazor WebAssembly Application

1. **Open the terminal in Visual Studio Code.**
2. **Navigate to the directory where you want to create the project**
3. **Create a new Blazor WebAssembly application using the `dotnet` CLI:**
```sh
dotnet new blazorwasm -n 06_blazor_app
```
This command creates a new directory named `06_blazor_app` with the necessary files for a Blazor WebAssembly application.

4. **Navigate to the project directory:**
```sh
cd 06_blazor_app
```

5. Optional: **Open the project in Visual Studio Code:**
```sh
code .
```

#### Understanding the Project Structure
- `wwwroot`: This directory contains static files such as CSS, JavaScript, and images.
- `Pages`: This directory contains Razor components, which are used to build the UI of the application.
- `Shared`: This directory contains shared components that can be used across different pages.
- `Program.cs`: This is the main file where the application starts executing. It contains the `Main` method and sets up the Blazor WebAssembly host.
- `06_blazor_app.csproj`: This is the project file that contains information about the project and its dependencies.

#### Running the Blazor WebAssembly Application
To run the application, use the following command in the terminal:
```sh
dotnet run
```
